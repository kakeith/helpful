# Helpful

I've assembed a collection of helpful commands (which I tend to forget) as well as scripts I use to organize my experiments. 

### gsheets/
Scripts to upload a csv to Google Sheets from the Google Sheets API. (Helpful when you're moving csv's from a remote server and want to view and share them in a Google folder)
