When starting a new project here are the steps to go through: 

(1) Make a github repo for the project. 
-Add a .gitignore

-Create a .latex file where you will keep a paper draft and notes for a paper. 

(4) mkdir lit_review/ 
-Store any pdfs here, which you will highlight and take notes on directly. Label the pdfs with the same labeling at the bib entry so you can access them easily. 
-Create a .bib file for the papers that are worthy and keep notes directly in the .bib file 

(5) Buy a plain manilla folder where you will keep any pdfs you print out. For the printouts make sure to write 'PRINTED OUT' on top of the electronic version of the pdf.
